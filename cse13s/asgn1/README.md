# Assignment 0 - Pass the Pigs

This C program simulates the dice game Pass the Pigs.
It makes use of random in order to simulate the rolling of dice.
It also uses basic loops/conditionals and user input in order to simulate
play of the game, including the adding of points and moving between players. 
Note: building the program with make requires the use of a Makefile 
alongside the main program.

```
$ make
```

## Running
