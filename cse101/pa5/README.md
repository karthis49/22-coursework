README for Programming Assignment 5

List.cpp:
List ADT containing all specified functions
NOTE: 

1) insertBefore() and insertAfter() was done 
with help from tutor psuedocode during lab hours

2) cleanup() function was done with help using
pseudocode provided by the tutor Sebastian

List.h:
Header file for List ADT
NOTE: I edited this file just to add a header comment. I wasn't sure if this was 
necessary because the assigment says to not alter List.h, but I put the header
comment there just to be safe.

ListTest.cpp:
Test file for List ADT
Tests all functions in List.cpp

Shuffle.cpp:
Main file containing File IO and use of List ADT
Used to shuffle decks of cards (or Lists) up to a 
specified size (from command line) and count the number
of shuffles to return deck to its original state

Makefile:
Makefile for Assignment 5

Run with:
make: ListTest or Shuffle
run: ./ListTest or ./Shuffle

No extra notes
