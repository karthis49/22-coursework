# Assignment 2 - A Little Slice of Pi

This C programs make use of multiple files, a test harness, and a Makefile in order to 
approximate the natural number e, pi, and the square roots of numbers.
Note: the build and run commands correspond to the Makefile and test harness.

## Building

Build the program with:

```
$ make
```

## Running

Run the program with:

```
$ ./mathlib-test -aebmrvnsh
```

## Errors

There are no errors to be expected when building and running the program.
